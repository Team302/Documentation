# Documentation

Welcome to Team 302 Documentation.  This project contains information to help the software subteam.  

Currently, there is an Environment folder that contains information about our environment.  For example, there is a file that lists the tools we use and where you can get them.

More folders/files will be added, so check back here if you are looking for something related to developing software for the Team302 Robot.   If you don't find it ask (Mentors, Student Leads, Other Software Team Members) because if you need it and can't find it chances are someone else will also have the same need.
